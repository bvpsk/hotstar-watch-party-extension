Watch Party is a feature that allowed people to connect and watch people who are at distant places.

My motivation for taking up this project is primarily for job interviews, and secondarily, we need a hotstar watch party as the content here is awesome.

This is a hobby project and at the current stage this is merely a Proof of Concept(POC) than an MVP.

This feature can only be used by people who have a valid hotstar account. There is no piracy involved in this. This extension will only manipulate the page view and adds chatting and video control functionalities via a chat server I've implemented. I hope i'm not exploiting any hotstar's resources. I've only done this project to display my skills for my interviews and I request to please bring to my notice if i'm violating any policies of hotstar or any other company.
